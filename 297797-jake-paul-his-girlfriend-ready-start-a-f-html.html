While Rose's boyfriend initially gained fame through social media, she had a different way of cementing her name publicly.</p><p class=dh>Known as the "World Series Flasher," Rose became known when she and Lauren Summer lifted their tops to flash Gerrit Cole of the Houston Astros. The inappropriate incident happened in 2019, during the fifth game of the MLB World Series.</p><p class=dh>According to Rose, exposing her bare body was a <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/12328944/jake-paul-ex-girlfriend-julia-rose/>publicity stunt</a> to promote Shagmag, her magazine.
