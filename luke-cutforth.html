And has been described as a cross between 28 Days Later and Cloverfield due to its Cinéma vérité style. However, the production of the film was canceled in 2010 after the deaths of Cutforth’s Grandfather and close friend.</p><p>He was once in discussions for a film called “The Snitch”, written by Joshua Hawkins. But was eventually unable to secure funding for the film due to certain controversial issues that the film raised, which investors thought may be seen as overly controversial, and so the production of the film was canceled.</p><h4><span>Planned Films</span></h4><p>During his time on “The Faces of Blood”, Cutforth also planned and wrote two other films. Even-though production details were never announced, Cutforth still seems keen to produce the films.
