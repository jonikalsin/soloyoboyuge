The first time, they appeared in season 7, many accused Juliana of being a gold digger. However, the rest appreciated her kind-hearted nature, which even managed to befriend Michael’s ex-wife Sarah.</span></p><p><span>The couple then went on to get engaged in 2019, and the same year, on October 12, the duo tied the knot in an intimate wedding ceremony.</span></p><p><span>Unfortunately, two years after their marriage, Michael announced their split exactly on their second wedding anniversary. “Today is only our second wedding anniversary and, sadly, our last,” he wrote over IG.</span></p><p><span>Michael then followed it with a few words of kindness about Julia and went on to blame the coronavirus pandemic for leaving them both “drained.” Also, he admitted that he “did not maintain the strength of mind and the fortitude to be the husband” that Julia wanted him to be.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“All along, I failed to recognize that you were there for me,” Michael added.</span></p><p><span>As for Julia’s take on the matter, she shared that she “needed” to leave as she wasn’t herself anymore.

Ever since Juliana was a kid, her family always struggled financially. She was always forced to support her entire family, and rumors even had that she was trafficked as a child model.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The disparity between Michael’s wealth and their financial struggles was also the reason why Juliana’s family wasn’t invited to their wedding. “It would be weird and maybe uncomfortable for Juliana for them to see what would look like a lot of opulence and then they would be leaning on her about, well, we need help,” Michael said.</span></p><p><span>But Juliana understands the situation. She also admitted to her family expecting Michael’s money. “I wish I could give my lifestyle to all my friends and family, but I can’t help everyone,” she added.</span></p><p><span>On Dec 12, 2021, Juliana shared photos of her father and grandmother on IG mentioning that she also found photos of her father’s “accident” that “broke her heart.” Although she soon removed the post, fans who saw it beforehand believed that her father died tragically before she was able to know him</span></p><p><span>As for Juliana’s mom, she was doing well in 2021.
