At the time, the actor was was fresh off of his Oscar nomination for Best Actor in <strong>Steven Spielberg's</strong> Schindler's List. He was also newly involved with fellow actor Richardson, who he had met while acting in the play Anna Christie on Broadway. Although Richardson was then married to producer <strong>Robert Fox</strong>, sparks flew between the two actors and they soon became a couple.</p><p>"I'd never had that kind of an <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>explosive chemistry situation</a> with an actor, or actress," Liam recalled on 60 Minutes in 2014.

The Love Actually actor later said that his new relationship kept him from even taking a meeting about playing Bond.</p><p>"When I first started getting a couple of calls from Barbara Broccoli about would I be interested, and I said yeah, I would be interested," he said on the podcast Conan O'Brien Needs a Friend, <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>as quoted by The Irish Sun</a>. "And Natasha and I weren't married at the time and she said, 'If you are offered James Bond, we're not getting married.'"</p><p>In an interview with Rolling Stone earlier this year, he shared that <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>the character's reputation for womanizing</a> was part of what made Richardson put her foot down.</p><p>"She gave me a James Bond ultimatum," Neeson said.

"I would tease her by going behind her back, making my fingers as though I'm holding a gun, and then [hums the James Bond theme]," he told Rolling Stone. "I loved doing that [expletive]!"<span aria-hidden=true>ae0fcc31ae342fd3a1346ebb1f342fcb</span></p><p>However, the actor also admitted he was not a serious contender for Bond, saying on <strong>Conan O'Brien's </strong>podcast, "I wasn't offered James Bond, I think I was on their radar for five minutes."</p><p>He did go on to win a more important role, however, becoming Richardson's husband in July of 1994.

Tragically, their happiness ended in 2009 when Richardson fell while skiing on Mont Tremblant in Quebec and <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>suffered a traumatic brain injury</a>. The <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>actor passed away</a> on March 18, 2009 at age 45.</p><p>Neeson told Rolling Stone that he kept his family afloat after Richardson's passing with the help of mother-in-law <strong>Vanessa Redgrave</strong> and sister-in-law <strong>Joely Richardson</strong> and by staying busy in film. "I remember calling my agent and I said, 'I don't care what it is. I'll take anything. I have to work,'" he said.</p><p>While the role of 007 ended up going to <strong>Pierce Brosnan</strong> (and later <strong>Daniel Craig</strong>), the work Neeson threw himself into would eventually give him a second chance at spy movies. In 2008, he originated the role of ex-CIA agent Bryan Mills in the Bourne-inspired action flick Taken, reprising the role in 2012 and 2014 sequels. Asked what Richardson would have thought about his late-career action movie star status, he told 60 Minutes, "She'd be tickled."</p><p><strong>For more celebrity nostalgia sent right to your inbox,&nbsp;<a rel="no-opener noopener noreferrer" href=#>sign up for our daily newsletter</a>.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmialajBrbXFnqanpJmjsm%2BvzqZmpaGRonqvscSspqdlnpbBor%2FHmmSroZOdrrOw0qilZqWfq7amedGoo55n</p></div><div id=links><a href=./millicent-simmonds.html>&#171;&nbsp;Millicent Simmonds Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story</a>
