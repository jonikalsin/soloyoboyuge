He is <strong>38 years old</strong> and is under the birth sign, Virgo. He holds American nationality.</p><p>His mother’s name is Marlene and his father’s name is Charles Trippy II. He also has a sibling who is a sister and her name is Melissa. Likewise, he doesn’t talk much about his parents on social media platforms. But he has featured his parents in his YouTube videos.

However, the names of the school and high school are not available at the moment.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-72131 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Charles-Trippy-Mother.jpg alt="Charles Trippy" width=650 height=365 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-72131 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Charles Trippy along with his mother (Source: Youtube)</p><h2><span id=Charles_Trippy_8211_Career_and_Professional_Life>Charles Trippy – Career and Professional Life</span></h2><p>Following Charles’s father’s footsteps as a musician, he has also joined a band, “We the Kings” as a bassist and is quite the flame on YouTube. And, Trippy and his vlog team sure know how to keep the audience engaged. Likewise, his immense talents are going through the roof. Trippy didn’t always intend to become a social media star. All he ever wanted was to stick by his overnight decision of vlogging for one year straight, without missing a day.</p><p>Then, launching a web series called “Internet Killed Television (Aka CTFxC)”, with his then-wife Allie Rose Speed and their dogs, she began uploading around 15-20 minutes of daily vlogs that centered on his little family. He shot on a Canon PowerShot ELPH 340 HS and his vlogs soon caught the eye of a loyal audience who enjoyed the snippets of his life through his lens. Then, soon enough he crossed his one-year mark of daily vlogs, however, he didn’t stop the daily vlogs.</p><p>Eventually crossing four years of steady vlogging, she entered the Guinness World Record for most daily video blogs shared on YouTube. And, also in its 8th year, “Internet Killed Television” gained ground as one of the best and most unique YouTube channels that got recognition by the “Ripley’s Believe it or Not” publications as well.</p><h4><span>More About Youtube…</span></h4><p>Moreover, the highly talked about series that debuted in the year 2009 featured his ex-wife till the year 2014 and had major events of his life such as marriage, cancer battles, and divorce which were documented for the audience. And, the video blogs now include his current fiancee, Allie Wes, and her dog Diesel, sparing no details that make their rather eventful life worth the watch. Now a channel that offers more than just their daily updates, the channel even hosts some of the wildest challenges with Allie and even her dad.</p><p>Likewise, CTFxC, no doubt, has some of the finest content that will turn anyone into a subscriber. She is also the owner of a secondary YouTube channel, where he mostly uploads “Me vs You” videos that revolve around challenges and games. This trooper of a YouTuber sure knows how to up his social media game. His channel has been covered by major news publications around the world including BBC, ABC News, Forbes, etc.</p><p>She also owns a third Youtube channel under the name “Trippy”. He shares quick little videos that are shot by his iPhone on this channel. However, this channel is not as popular as his main one but is slowly gaining viewers and subscribers as well.
